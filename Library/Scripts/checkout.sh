# HEADs instead — e.g. to check whether a pin can be advanced — with:
#   PINNED=0 ./Library/Scripts/checkout.sh
# Gershwin's own repositories are never pinned; they always track their branch.
#
# Build against a feature branch where it exists (e.g. a "dev" channel) with:
#   BRANCH=dev ./Library/Scripts/checkout.sh
# For each repo that HAS the branch on its remote it is cloned/checked out;
# repos without it fall back to their default branch. Unset (the default)
# leaves behaviour identical to before.

# Pinned commits, as "<repo name> <commit>". These are upstream libraries; we pin
# them so we don't develop against a moving target and so the patches under
# Library/Patches/ keep applying. Every entry here must be a non-Gershwin repo —
# Gershwin's own repositories track their branch and are deliberately absent.
# Refreshed 2026-07-26. Every patch under Library/Patches/ was dry-run against
# these commits. libs-gui is held a day behind its HEAD: dropdown-tracking.patch
# does not apply to the 2026-07-26 commits.
