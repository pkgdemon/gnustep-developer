# gershwin-developer

This is intended for Gershwin developers only.  For more stable packaging with applied defaults use GhostBSD.

## Supported Operating Systems

* FreeBSD
* GhostBSD (requires `pkg install -g 'GhostBSD*-dev'` for building)
* OpenBSD
* Arch Linux
* Artix (Arch Linux without systemd)
* Debian
* Devuan (Debian without systemd)
* Void Linux (runit)

## Requirements for building

* root access
* git (e.g., `pkg install git-lite`) (NOTE: Need to use `/usr/local/bin/git` on FreeBSD freshly installed system when chrooted at the end of the installation)

## Building from source, installation and uninstallation

After installing, configuring the above requirements run the following commands as root:

```
git clone https://github.com/gershwin-desktop/gershwin-developer.git /Developer
cd /Developer && make install
```

`make install` runs the whole sequence itself: `bootstrap.sh` (build
dependencies), `checkout.sh` (sources into `Library/Sources`), the full system
domain build, and finally `dscli init` to set up Directory Services. Every step
is idempotent, so the same command also updates an existing installation.

To build against the sources already checked out, without bootstrapping or
refreshing them, use `make system` instead.

To remove Gershwin installed from sources run the following as root:

```
cd /Developer && make uninstall
```

## Requirements for usage

* xorg or xlibre
* At runtime, the packages mentioned in the respective `.dependencies` file

## Usage

After making sure usage requirements are met the following should be run as regular user to start Gershwin after logging in:

```
startx /System/Library/Scripts/Gershwin.sh
```

or:

```
/System/Library/Scripts/LoginWindow.sh # Starts the X server automatically
```

or, on FreeBSD/GhostBSD: 

```
service loginwindow enable && service loginwindow start
```

## Optional libraries
* libdbus for waiting for the Global Menu to appear and for implementing the FileManager1 service that lets, e.g., web browsers, open the file manager to show the downloaded files
* libsquashfs for AppImage icons

## Build targets

`make install` builds and installs the entire system domain. The build is also
split into granular targets so a single component can be (re)built on its own —
useful for CI and incremental development. Every per-component target requires
the core libraries to be installed first (`make corelibs`). All targets run as
root, like `make install`.

| Target | Builds |
| --- | --- |
| `corelibs` | core libraries (libdispatch, libobjc2, tools-make, libs-base, libs-gui, libs-back) plus gershwin-system, gershwin-assets and the plistupdate hook |
| `workspace` | gershwin-workspace |
| `dock` | apps-dock (DockWM) |
| `systempreferences` | gershwin-systempreferences |
| `terminal` | gershwin-terminal |
| `textedit` | gershwin-textedit |
| `windowmanager` | gershwin-windowmanager |
| `components` | gershwin-components (Menu, DirectoryServices, LoginWindow, …) |
| `dubstep-theme` | dubstep-dark-theme (GSTheme bundle, installed to /System/Library/Themes) |
| `dscli-init` | runs `dscli init` (Directory Services: /Local skeleton, admin account, nsswitch and sudoers) |

For example, build the core libraries once and then just (re)build the workspace:

```
cd /Developer
make corelibs
make workspace
```

## Pinned upstream libraries

The upstream libraries (`libobjc2`, `tools-make`, `libs-base`, `libs-gui`,
`libs-back`, `libs-av`, `libs-steptalk`, `swift-corelibs-libdispatch`) are
checked out at pinned commits by default, so that the sources we build are the
sources the patches in `Library/Patches/` were written against. Without the pins
an upstream commit can silently break a patch and fail the build.

Gershwin's own repositories are **never** pinned — they always track their
branch, so the build picks up our work as it lands.

To check whether a pin can be advanced, build against the upstream HEADs
instead:

```
PINNED=0 /Developer/Library/Scripts/checkout.sh
```

The pins live in the `PINS` list at the top of `checkout.sh`.

## Skipping repositories during checkout

`checkout.sh` clones every repository the build needs. Set `SKIP_REPOS` to a
space- or comma-separated list of repository names to skip cloning/updating some
of them — handy when you provide a repository's sources yourself (for example a
CI checkout of the component under test, symlinked into `Library/Sources/`):

```
SKIP_REPOS="gershwin-workspace gershwin-terminal" /Developer/Library/Scripts/checkout.sh
```

## Building against a development or feature branch

By default `checkout.sh` clones each repository's default branch. Set `BRANCH`
to build against another branch instead — most commonly a `dev` branch holding
work in progress *before it lands in the default branch*:

```
BRANCH=dev /Developer/Library/Scripts/checkout.sh
```

`BRANCH` is generic — any branch name works — so it doubles as a tool for
testing a feature branch across repositories:

```
BRANCH=my-feature /Developer/Library/Scripts/checkout.sh
```

For each repository that **has** the named branch, it is cloned/checked out on
that branch; repositories **without** it fall back to their default branch, so a
partial rollout (where only some repos have the branch yet) just works. The run
logs which repository used the branch and prints a summary at the end. Leaving
`BRANCH` unset keeps the previous behaviour, and `BRANCH` can be combined with
`PINNED` and `SKIP_REPOS`.
